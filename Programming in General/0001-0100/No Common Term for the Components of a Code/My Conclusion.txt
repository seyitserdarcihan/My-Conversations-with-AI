I'd like to make an analogy to express my conclusion.

In the physical material world, there is not a common term for everything, if I'm right. 
Let me explain:

You call a stone an object.
You call walking a movement.
You call sleeping a state.
You call hearing a perception.



You call object an X.
You call movement an X.
You call state an X.
You call hearing an X.

Let's name X 'phenomenon'.

Now, my search is:
What is the equivalent of 'phenomenon' in software world.

Note:
Exclude all hardware-related terms. I do not seek a common term for these two terms:
- motherboard
- assignment operator


I search for a common term between these terms:
- operating system
- data type

Do you get what I mean?
There is no common term for every meaningful entity in software world, is there?
Until someone tells me what is the common term or I find it myself, 
until then, I coin it myself. Here is the common term for everything in software world for me:



softhing



I repeat, the term 'softhing' excludes every hardware term. 
The word 'softhing' is a portmanteau of 'software' and 'thing'.
The letter 't' here is intersection of two pieces of the portmanteau: 'soft' + 'thing'.

I talk too much, don't I?
