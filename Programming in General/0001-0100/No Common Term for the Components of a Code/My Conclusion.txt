I'd like to make an analogy to express my conclusion.

In the physical material world, there is not a common term for everything. 
Let me explain:

You call a stone an object.
You call walking a movement.
You call sleeping a state.
You call hearing a perception.



You call object an X.
You call movement an X.
You call state an X.
You call hearing an X.

Let's name X 'phenomenon'.


Now, my search is:
What is the equivalent of 'phenomenon' in software world.

Note:
Exclude all hardware-related terms. I do not seek a common term for these two terms:
- motherboard
- assignment operator


I search for a common term between these terms:
- operating system
- data type

Do you get what I mean?

There is no common term for every meaningful entity in software world, is there?
